This is my Neovim config

My journey.
I started to use vi many years ago. Moved to Vim and then to Neovim. I never used Vim for software development, only for 

Like many others I loved tinkering with the configuration but as usual not much was done of what I was actually supposed to do. I rewrote my vimrc to lua, went from packer to `lazy.nvim` but finally decided to use an already preconfigured neovim. Det finns manga trevliga paketerade konfigurationer till Neovim sasom LunarVim, NVChad, AstroVim, LazyVim and some great starting configuration templates such as `nvim-basic-ide`, NormalNvim

Use CTRL-U CTRL-D CTRL-B CTRL-F gg G for vertical movement outside the screen.

Use word-motion (w W b B e E ge gE) for short-distance horizontal movement.

Use f F t T , ; 0 ^ $ for medium to long-distance horizontal movement.

Use operator + motion/text-object (eg: ci{ y5j dap) whenever possible.

Use % and square bracket commands (see :h [) to jump between brackets.
