# To keep this file in sync I'm avoiding to install with the `brew install` command, 
# instead I'm adding a row to this file and run 'brew bundle --global' to make sure it's working. 

# https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle
# Always run 'brew update' before running 'brew bundle'

# 
# It's not always easy to understand how the dsl for bundle is constructed without reading the code.
# I know people have asked for clarification in the documentation but it has not been 
# well received by {noname}. Haven't found any changelog either but heck, it's open source ;-)
